The file read operations can be performed using functions fscanf or fgets. Both the functions performed the same operations as that of printf and gets but with an additional parameter, the file pointer. So, it depends on you if you want to read the file line by line or character by character. The file write operations can be perfomed by the functions fprintf and fputs with similarities to read operations.
